# FerriMetric---an-AI-Nutrition-Deficiencies-PredictionApplication
Designed with team in Boston University , Sep 2023-Dec2023

· Project Overview: Co-designed FerriMetric, an python-based AI tool for predicting nutritional deficiencies by analyzing iron bioavailability and transferrin saturation to evaluate dietary health risks.Presented research at the Boston University Research Fair.

· Data Integration & Processing: Integrated with a nutrition API to crawl and extract the nutritional information of top 5 popular meals from 10 countries using English. Cleaned and prepared data into json format.

· Algorithm Development & Prediction: Applied a Random Forest algorithm on the processed data to to predict patients' iron bioavailability and transferrin saturation,using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.


This is a corporated project , since it was a project for a company called Synthera Health, I can only post the poster and a summary version.
