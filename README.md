# FerriMetric---an-AI-Nutrition-Deficiencies-PredictionApplication
Designed with team in Boston University , Sep 2023-Dec2023

•  Project Overview: Co-developed FerriMetric, an python-based AI tool predicting nutritional deficiencies by analyzing iron bioavailability and transferrin saturation. Presented at BU Research Fair.
•  Data Integration: Used a nutrition API to extract data from 5 popular meals in 10 countries, cleaning and formatting into JSON.
•  Algorithm & Prediction: Applied a Random Forest algorithm to predict iron bioavailability using Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn.

This is a corporated project , since it was a project for a company called Synthera Health, I can only post the poster and a summary version.
